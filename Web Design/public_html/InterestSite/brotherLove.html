    <h1>Brotherly Love</h1>
    <img src="images/BrotherLove.jpg" class="WrapPicture"/>
    <p> As members of a nationwide Fraternity, Brotherly Love is the quality we all keep closest to our hearts.  It is the glue that holds us together as one organization, and the passion that helps us push our limits.  Without Brotherly Love, a fraternity is nothing, just like without nails, a house is just a pile of debris.  <br/><br/>Because of these reasons, conflicts within the fraternity are held as our highest priority.  If a conflict were left to marinate, it will only create more stress on the strings that hold us together, so we always nip these issues at the bud.  Whatever conflict, we always bring both of the conflicting members to a jury of their brothers, and allow both of them to make their argument.  After they have both made their argument, we discuss among the jury and eboard to decide what to do about this issue.  These meetings can get very long and hard, but in the end when we come out with a comprimise, it is always worth it.  <br/><br/> Brotherly Love is top priority when initiating new members, we all must make sure they will abide by the rules herein and respect each other as brothers and as other human beings.</p>
