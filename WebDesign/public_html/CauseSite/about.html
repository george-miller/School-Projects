        <h3>General Knowledge</h3>
        <p>Cancer is a group of diseases that cause abnormal cell growth.  This abnormal growth causes certain areas of the body to expand and take up more resources and energy than they are supposed to.  For example, if a tumor was growing in someone's brain, and it's growth put pressure on the area of the brain that creates memories, that person could experience memory loss. </p>

        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>The most widespread treament used today is chemotherapy.  In chemotherapy, raditation is used to kill the cancer cells.  Exposing them to radiation causes the cells to malfunction, and usually die.  However, the main risk in this treatment option is that this radiation can kill healthy cells also.  This is why many people experince heavy side effects from chemotherapy, like nausia, fatigue, and pain.  There are also a bunch of other methods of treatment, including herbal treatments and stress relief tactics, designed to help the person fight of the cancer with the power of their mind and psyche.  Although it may seem ridiculous, this style has actually worked on a lot of patients, and is my personal favorite.</p>

        <h3>What can I do??</h3>
        <p>There is little us common folk web developers can do, because we really don't know the in depth science behind cancer.  It takes years and years to learn all of the chemical and biological processes that relate to cancer.  However, what we can do is leave it to the professionals.  There are labs all over the country doing tests and research to help find a cure, and they need our help.  They don't make a profit, so they need people like us to donate, so that they can continue to look for a cure, and hopefully, someday find it.</p>
