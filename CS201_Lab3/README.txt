This was a lab I did for my CSO (Computer Systems Organization) class.  It required us to implement 3 different page replacment policies: first in first out, least recently used, and one of our own implementation.  The memory is depicted as an array and all the replacment policy does is modify values of that array to simulate what a real OS would do.  I attached the instructions and some test files.
