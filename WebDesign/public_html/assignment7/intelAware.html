    <h1>Intellectual Awareness</h1>
    <img src="images/intelAware.jpg" class="WrapPicture"/>
    <p> Intellectual Awareness is the key to unlocking the power of the mind.  As Zeta Beta Tau brothers, we all challenge ourselves on a daily basis to go beyond the expectations set for us, setting new expectations for ourselves.  We also challenge each other, combining and recombining our individual skills to think up ways to do things for our community like raise money for charity, or do things a little more personal like win Greek Week, the week longcompetition between all fraternities and sororities.  <br/><br/>We also require all our brothers to keep a stable GPA above 3.0, so that we all can keep on top of our studies.  If anyone goes below that requirment, we will do our best to help our brother in any way we can, tutoring or helping him get in touch with his professors to figure out what the problem is.  This requirement is not just to keep our title secure, we are all striving to push the limits of todayâ€™s society, and how can we do that without keeping on top of our academia?  <br/><br/>The most important piece of Intellectual Awareness for ZBT brothers is the awareness to see when something is wrong.  A party or mixer could get out of control, and it requires a group effort to keep something like that under control.  We could not have these great times without the security of knowing that none of our brothers will break the law or make a bad decision, putting the whole rest of the fraternity under the bus.  </p>
