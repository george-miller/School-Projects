To see the circuit I created, you must open mipsProcessor.circ with Logisim (you can get Logisim here http://www.cburch.com/logisim/)

To run a test program, you must right click on the Instruction Memory (the ROM on the left hand side next to the PC) and click "Load Image", then select either prog1.txt or prog2.txt.  
To load the Data Memory, right click on the RAM on the right side and click "Load Image" then select the mem*.txt with the same number (if you picked prog1 use mem1, if you picked prog2 use mem2).

Then simply use the finger tool (control+1) to click the clock and make the program run!
